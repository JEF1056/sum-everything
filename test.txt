Planet: Eteran

Fall, First Insurgency War4

Ava

'Your father's coming home for your graduation year.'

It's what drove her to work on schoolwork in the early mornings. James, her twin brother, could be indifferent, almost displeased at the news, but there was nothing she wanted more than to make Dad proud. Nothing was more important than showing Dad she tried as hard as she could to pursue her dreams. If it had been any other time, she'd spend the weekend helping Meryn with his advanced classes, or James with his perpetual block that had plagued him since the Quadrum started. All she could focus on was her goal.

Light hushes of wind pushed through their sliding window, ruffling her papers detailing the uses and theories of edevium. Sunlight crept through the slotted blinds. Breaths of the morning, which always flowed around Eastpoint, her hometown. She turned. Pictures her brother took littered his side of the room, beautiful moments in time captured in a frozen frame. Between each picture, snippets of his writing to go along with the pictures, from poetry to the smallest stories.

"It's morning already?" she questioned to herself.

Time flew by so fast, without her brother to capture it.1

"It's morning already?" a drowsy, yet mocking voice sounded from the shape in her brother's bed.

James twisted onto his other side to ignore the flashing universe clock. He hadn't bothered to get up with the call of morning light. It was the best time to get up, and frankly, he could stand to add a little snapshot of dawn against all the stars he plastered at the top of his picture chain.

"How long have you been awake?"

"An... hour? Probably less than you have."

Ava shoved her schoolpad into her bag. "I didn't keep you up, did I?"

"Nope. Kept yourself up though, right?"

Ava deigned not to answer his snide question. Already donned in clothes, with her early morning shower long since refreshed her for the days ahead. From the hallway, the scent of buttered toast and scrambled eggs wafted through her nostrils. She hauled herself up from her desk, moving out to kick her younger sister's door. Another notorious sleeper. "Janelle," she said. "It's time to get up."1

Janelle threw something at the door, and she took that as an acknowledgement. Sizzled bubbles sounded from downstairs, and she returned to wake up her brother. From the lack of lights, James still hadn't gotten up.

"James." She folded her arms.

No response. He had fallen back asleep from the quiet breathing coming from his bed.

"You're going to miss breakfast."

Ah, we're going to have to do this again?

Ava moved for her bed, grabbing her cushion before turning to him. Taking aim, she counted down in her head. One. Two. Three. The pillow whizzed out of her hands and smacked her brother in the back of the head. He jolted up. Their shared dirty-blonde hair messed up from the sleep and pillow launch.

"Good morning," she said with a smile.

If looks could kill, she was certain she'd be dead. James clicked the UC, tapping settings into it as he blinked wearily. With a groan, he returned and curled further into the covers, pulling them over his head. Ava moved to the light panel of their room, raising the brightness before giving him another smile. "You know, maybe you'd get over your creative block if you tried something different." As she turned, a blast of air and something squishy smacked her in the back of the head. Whipping around, she spotted James giving her the same sneer. Ava clutched the door, then laughed. "I guess we'll call that a draw."

Her little sister had evidently finished with her preparations for the day, as she was bouncing at the table for breakfast. Ava took her regular seat, then eyed the chair where Dad sat whenever he was home. Empty, which it had been for quite some time.

"When's Dad coming home, exactly?" Ava indicated to his empty chair, looking at Mom.

"He'll hopefully be here when this weekend ends." Mom laughed. "He's very keen to see you. I will do the sausages in a moment."

James came down the staircase in the hall, refreshed and ready to go himself, for someone who kept having slow starts.
Keeping Janie in her side-eye, she started on her breakfast. Mom turned back when Janie clinked her fork against her plate.

"Janie, eat," she said. "Your teacher was telling me you haven't been eating your lunches at school."

Janie grumbled something under her breath as Mom passed them equal servings of sausage.

"And why haven't you been eating?" James took it upon himself to shift into Dad's role when Dad wasn't there, but that didn't mean Janie was ever agreeable to said arrangement.
Even as he made neat cuts into his food, Ava giggled when Janie glared through her at him. More grumbles left her mouth, and once again, a refusal to answer.

Ava sneered at her sister, whose hazel eyes widened slightly. She shook her blonde hair, its curls hitting her cheeks as she made wild gestures at her, mouth full of egg.

Oh, as if distracting me is going to work. Ava reached her fork to her sausages.

Her fork hit the plate with a defeated clink.

Ava turned to her brother as he ate. He didn't even meet her in the eye for his victory. He had way more food than what he started with. Beside her, Janie giggled. Mom joined them at the table, a happy smile on her face as she sat in the seat beside Dad's.

"Here, Janie." Ava turned her plate around for easy access to the scrambled eggs. "Try some."

"Ew..." Janie drawled, sticking her tongue out. "No, thanks."

Battle over, she leaned towards James. "Jamesy," she hissed under her breath while Mom ate. "Give me back my food."

Shared hazel eyes bore into her with a satisfied twinkle. He turned his plate so the sausages were between them. A different sort of victory, and she took her food back. "What are you planning to do today?" she asked.

"Oh, you know... Sit at the lakefront, and contemplate the meaning of our existence."

"Shut up."

"Take pictures and try to write in my notebook," James said with a huff. "I wasn't kidding about the first part, at least."

Chirps sounded from her pocket, rousing her from her conversation. As she took out her compearl to check the message, Janie smiled up at her. "Is that a special someone?" she drawled out the last word.

Ava nearly spat out her water in response. Swallowing to avoid the mess she'd have to clean up, she took a quick peek over the message. "It's Meryn," she explained. Half to her brother. Half to her sister, who thought every message Ava got was from a special someone.

'What do you have planned for the new kid when school starts back up from break?'

New kid? What new kid?

Ava clipped her compearl to her ear before wolfing down the rest of her food.
